# Welcome!
## This is the ChatGPT Discord Bot!

Want to add ChatGPT to your discord server? Use this easy and customizable repo to get started.

Be sure to set up your bot on the Discord Developer Portal, as well as your account on OpenAI as you will need your bot token and API key from there.

Create your ```app/keys.json``` like this:

```
{
    "keys" : {
        "openai" : "<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY-HERE>",
        "discord" : "<YOUR-DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN-HERE>"
    }

}
```

Just clone the repo and run:

- ```bash build.sh```
- ```bash app/start.sh```
